# eflomal
Efficient Low-Memory Aligner

This is a word alignment tool based on
[efmaral](https://github.com/robertostling/efmaral), with the following main
differences:
 * More compact data structures are used, so memory requirements are much
   lower (by orders of magnitude), at the cost of increasing the runtime by
   about three times (which still compares favorably to e.g. `fast_align`).
 * Simulated annealing is used instead of sampling alignment variable
   marginals, this also reduces memory consumption at the cost of some
   accuracy.

Technical details relevant to both `efmaral` and `eflomal` can be found in
the following article:
 * [Östling and Tiedemann (2016)](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pbml/106/art-ostling-tiedemann.pdf) ([BibTeX](http://www.robos.org/sections/research/robert_bib.html#Ostling2016efmaral)).

## Installing

To compile and install the C binary and the Python bindings:

    make
    sudo make install
    python3 setup.py install

edit `Makefile` manually if you want to install somewhere other than the
default `/usr/local/bin`.


## Using

There are three main ways of using `eflomal`:

 1. Directly call the `eflomal` binary. Note that this requires some
    preprocessing.
 2. Use the [align.py](./align.py) command-line interface, which is partly
    compatible with that of `efmaral`. Run `python3 align.py --help` for
    instructions.
 3. Use the Cython module to call the `eflomal` binary, this takes care of
    the preprocessing and file conversions necessary. See the docstrings
    in [eflomal.pyx](./python/eflomal/eflomal.pyx) for documentation.

In addition, there are convenience scripts for aligning and symmetrizing (with
the `atools` program from `fast_align`) as well as evaluating with data from
the WPT shared task datasets. These work the same way as in `efmaral`,
please see its
[README](https://github.com/robertostling/efmaral/blob/master/README.md) for
details.

## Performance

This is a comparison between eflomal,
[efmaral](https://github.com/robertostling/efmaral) and fast_align.

As the tables below show, both efmaral and eflomal beat fast_align in both
accuracy and CPU time by a comfortable margin. efmaral is somewhat more
accurate and sometimes faster (in wall time, with enough CPU cores) than
eflomal, but requires more RAM (hundreds of GB for large corpora).

Note that all timing figures below include alignments in both directions
(run in parallel) and symmetrization.
